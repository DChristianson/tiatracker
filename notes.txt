TODO:
- check for limits (7 instruments, frames etc.) on export
- lock ins/perc for import
- Sensible cycle values for sdlSound.set() calls (look up in real player)
- in emulation/bspf.h: #define BSPF_WINDOWS is hardcoded for Windows build
- Recover gracefully after trying to load corrupted track
- Set Goto dialog: Either a dropdown list of all sequence entries, or a label showing the target name for a given value
- Should paintEvents (timeline, patternEditor) obey the Track mutex?
  updateFirstNoteNumbers might otherwise be not fast enough in some cases?
- When exporting PURE_COMBINED, check if really both waveforms are used.
  (Store occurence in hashmap individually for 4 and 12)
- On new or open track, current perc (ins?) name gets taken over...?
- Add octave spinbox to PianoKeyboard
- Check for same envelopes in ins/perc on export, to save ROM
- add "freehand" option to Instruments tab
- Save import/export/load/save dirs in property file
