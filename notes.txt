TODO:
- Make sure PianoKeyboard.setUsePitchGuide() is correct for starting tab on startup
- Sensible cycle values for sdlSound.set() calls (look up in real player)
- NTSC/PAL in Stella: How? In SoundSDL2.cpp is setFrameRate() but does it do anything?
- in emulation/bspf.h: #define BSPF_WINDOWS is hardcoded for Windows build
- Do proper QThread (don't inherit from QThread) and set priority to highest
- add "freehand" option to Instruments tab
- add "0" octave (c0-h0)
- Check if "Envelope frames used" is correct (Pure Combined? Packing when exporting? ...)
- Context menu "insert before/after; delete" for columns in EnvelopeShaper
- Do proper OO: Base class Instrument gets inherited by MelodicInstrument and PercussionInstrument. Similarly with EnvelopeShaper, InstrumentShaper and PercussionShaper
