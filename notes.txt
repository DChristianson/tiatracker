- Improved timing precision of the tracker replayer
- Added ability to export song data to .csv (helps e.g. for syncing)
- Fix: "New..." now properly clears meta-data (author, name, comment, used pitch guide)
- Fix: "Play" in the tracker with each channel having varying pattern lengths now starts replay at the correct position for channel 1
